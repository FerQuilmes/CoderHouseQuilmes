        <p>
          Ownership is at the foundation of everything we do.<br><br>
          We look for owners who are empowered to lead positive change and take accountability for their results.<br><br>
          When we come together, we don’t let our titles define us; we push each other to find the best solutions for our business strategy.

      <div class="culture-block">
        <span class="label">DREAM BIG</span>
        <img src="../img/culture2.png" alt="Dream Big" />
        <p>
          We dream big because we believe that through collective focus, discipline, and the strength of our teams, we can achieve anything.<br><br>
          We empower our owners to push the boundaries of what’s possible to deliver on our strategy and purpose.<br><br>
          We look for people with passion, curiosity, and ambition to make a difference and grow with our business.

        <span class="label">MAKE IT HAPPEN</span>
        <img src="../img/culture3.png" alt="Make It Happen" />
        <p>
          We know that our actions matter more than words. We walk the talk, for there is no such thing as "this is not my problem."<br><br>
          We value resilience and commitment to excellence when facing challenges.<br><br>
          We look for people who know how to transform big dreams into measurable results and shared success through hard work, consistency, and long-term thinking.
